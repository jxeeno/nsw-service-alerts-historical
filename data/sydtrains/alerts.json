Buses are also replacing trains between Lithgow and Penrith on Blue Mountains Line.\n- Additional late night services will run from Central, Town Hall, St James and Martin Place stations to help you get home after the parade. Keep in mind that trains don't run all night on Mardi Gras, so if you¿re heading home after 01:00 on certain lines you may need to catch a NightRide bus instead. \n\nDetails: https://transportnsw.info/events/2020/02/sydney-gay-lesbian-mardi-gras-parade-2020",
