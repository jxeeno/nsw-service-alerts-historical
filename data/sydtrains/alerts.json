From there catch a light rail service or shuttle bus to Moore Park leaving from Chalmers Street.\n- Fans can also walk between Central and Moore Park via Devonshire St and the Albert `Tibby' Cotter Walkway to minimise wait times for transport services. \n\nNRL: Dragons v Raiders - WIN Stadium, Wollongong\n15:00 to 17:00\n- The closest station to WIN Stadium is Wollongong on the South Coast Line. The stadium is approximately 15 minutes walk from the station via Burelli Street.\n- Alternatively, you can catch the free Gong Shuttle from Crown Street which stops near the stadium.\n\n*Limited capacity events - attendees travelling by public transport should allow plenty of additional travel time and plan ahead by checking real-time capacity indicators where available as you may need to wait for the next service with available physical distancing capacity*\n\nDetails: https://transportnsw.info/events/2020/09",
